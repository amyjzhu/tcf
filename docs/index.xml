      <description>Need Help? If you need any assistance during the event, you have several options
Find a Volunteer Volunteers will be walking around the venue, and they&amp;rsquo;re all sporting an awesome TCF badge so they&amp;rsquo;re easy to spot.
Visit the Info Booth This booth is located at the front of the venue, and you probably passed it on the way in. Helpful volunteers will always be stationed here.
Contact Jerome Directly If you can&amp;rsquo;t find anyone and need help right away, just contact Jerome.</description>
