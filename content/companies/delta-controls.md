Delta is often described as a family. We call our Distributors ‘Partners’ because we recognize that their success is closely linked to ours. Our staff are even closer and we see the same longevity and stability in our workforce as we do in our Partner channel.

Most of us are geeks at heart and it is great fun to work with people as excited about electrical engineering and software development as we are – smart people who want to push technology forward. Buildings controllers may not sound interesting but we know that by making buildings more energy efficient we are making a substantial contribution to the betterment of our environment because buildings contribute more carbon than all the gas guzzling cars in the world.

We don’t just care for the environment; we look after our people with regular social and charity events that liven up the office or via the many classes in our well-equipped onsite gym.
