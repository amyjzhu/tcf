Are you motivated to work on products that have a meaningful impact?  At New Hippo Health, our mission is to build software products to fundamentally improve the Canadian healthcare system for patients, their family and friends, specialists, and clinical care teams.  We are a Vancouver-based startup founded by the CEOs of three notable companies: Crystal Decisions, Pulse Energy, and Eupraxia Pharmaceuticals.  Our distributed team is cross-functional and features clinical, business, technical, creative, and artistic talent.

Our headquarters are in downtown Vancouver and located close to designated bicycle routes, the Skytrain and Seabus, and many lunch-time options.  We have a distributed team and are flexible so people can work from home when needed.  Applicants from across Canada who can work from home are encouraged to apply. We have competitive vacation, time off, and extended health insurance benefits.  We also provide a health spending account for employees to prioritize their discretionary health spending and we support bike commuting and using public transit by covering 25% of transit passes and commuting-related bike maintenance costs.
