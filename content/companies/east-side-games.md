East Side Games is a proudly independent and profitable game studio creating humorous and addicting games for mobile and social platforms. 

We have a collaborative, creative, and fun culture that is focused on building hit titles in a great work environment. Our talented, highly-motivated team believes in constantly improving; we are not afraid to take ownership and meet challenges head-on in order to reach our goals. 

Purpose-built technology infrastructure powers our rapid, iterative prototyping, based directly on audience feedback. These tools and analytics engines allow us to take design ideas to playable releases in days rather than months. 
Our games fund all our new projects, and everyone who works here has a direct impact on the day-to-day business.
