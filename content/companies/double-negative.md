We are Double Negative (DNEG), one of the world’s leading visual effects and
animation companies for feature film and television, with studios in London,
Vancouver, Mumbai, Los Angeles, Chennai and Montréal.

Founded with a team of just 30 in London in 1998, we now employ over 2,500
people across our global offices. Our creative drive and close collaborative
working relationship with filmmakers ensures that the projects that we work on,
large and small, all receive the same high standards of creative and technical
service.

This has proven to be a winning approach, resulting in three Academy Award wins,
for our VFX work on ‘Inception’, ‘Interstellar’ and most recently ‘Ex Machina’;
BAFTA’s for ‘Inception’, ‘Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part 2’ and
‘Interstellar’; and Visual Effects Society awards for ‘Inception’, ‘Sherlock
Holmes’ and ‘Interstellar’.
