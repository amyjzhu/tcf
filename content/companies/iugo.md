IUGO (iug≈ç: I - YOU - GO), a latin word meaning to connect, is our ultimate goal: To connect gamers with fun and amplified mobile gaming experiences. We emerged as a mobile-only game studio in Vancouver, and have continued to create and operate large-scale free-to-play mobile games on iOS and Android.

Since our founding in 2003, we have created over 30 mobile games, including self-published original games like ToyBot Diaries and Implode, as well as partner-published chart topping hits like The Walking Dead: Road To Survival, and Knights & Dragons.

Alongside our fun, food-filled, Beer Friday culture; we operate with innovative, lean, dedicated, and focused teams, who seek out unexplored mobile territory to bring you the next big thing.
